# Reaction Classification with CNN

This repository contains the code for a Reaction Classification task using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle [Include Kaggle Dataset Link]. It consists of reactions labeled for classification.

## Model

The model architecture used for this task is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN is designed to learn hierarchical features from the reaction data for effective classification.

## Results

- **Train Accuracy**: 90%
- **Test Accuracy**: 78%

The model achieved a train accuracy of 90% on the training dataset and 78% on the test dataset. These results indicate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

## Usage

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DreamIsMl/Reaction-Classification-Using-Cnn.git
